Did you notice a new file in the assignment?

I added a file called .gitignore

This file is used by git to ignore certain files folders etc. It helps us in case we accidentally
commit files we shouldn't, like PyCharm files.

Remember to create a .gitignore for all projects. Anything we put in the .gitignore will NOT
be tracked with version control.
